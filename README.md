GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls two dices as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1 in one of his dices, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- By default the first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game, the winning score can be changed in the "Final Score" field
